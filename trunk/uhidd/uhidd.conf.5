.Sh NAME
.Nm uhidd.conf
.Nd uhidd configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration file is read at initial startup of the
.Xr uhidd 8
daemon to specify the configuration parameters of
each sub driver or the daemon itself.
.Pp
The configuration file consists of a list of options.
options are assignemnts written in the form
.Dq Ar name Ns Li = Ns Ar value .
A option name can be a device identifier or a driver parameter.
A value is either a quoted string or a list of sub options.
The syntax of a option with a list of options as value
is:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
name={
	option
	...
	option
}
.Ed
.Pp
The following is a list of options supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent-three
.It Va device_identifier
.Pq Vt list
The device_identifier consist of vendor id, product id
and the optional interface number. The option name is
written as
.Va vid:pid[:iface] .
vid and pid are hexadecimals with prefix
.Dq 0x ,
while iface is a single decimal number (e.g. 0x045e:0x00f9:1).
The value of this option is a list of sub options that apply
to the specified device interface. If iface is omitted, sub options
apply to all interfaces of the device. Also there is a special
device identifier called
.Va default :
Sub options under
.Va default
apply to all the devices.
.It Va kbd_attach
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
enable the keyboard driver and attach it to the
keyboard apolication collection.
.It Va mouse_attach
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
enable the mouse driver and attach it to the mouse
application collection.
.It Va vhid_attach
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
enable the virtual general hid driver and attach it to any
application collection that doesn't have a specific driver.
.It Va vhid_strip_id
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
instruct the vhid driver to strip the leading report id byte
before passing the report to user.
.It Va cc_attach
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
enable the consumer control driver and attach it to the
consumer control application collection. Consumer control
driver provides general support for multimedia keys found
in USB keyboard.
.It Va cc_keymap
.Pq Vt list
This option specify the keymap for multimedia keys. The value
is a list of sub options
.Pq key bindings .
Each sub option has
the form
.Dq Ar usage Ns Li = Ns Ar keycode
and specify exact one key binding between a USB HID usage and a
keycode. For example,
.Em Mute Ns Li = Ns Dq Em 0x60
will bind multimedia key
.Em Mute
to keycode 0x60. Normally, mapping usage to
already assigned keycodes and causing conflicts is not desired.
See
.Sx FREEKEYS
section below for a list of currently unused keycodes. Also refer
to the
.Em HID Usage Tables
in the USB specification for a list of
usage names.

#
# For all devices, attach mouse and consumer control driver but
# do not attach keyboard and vhid driver. (say, keyboard is
# handled by the kernel driver ukbd(4) instead). Provide a global
# keymap which binds 4 multimedia keys found on most multimedia
# USB keyboard.

keyboard infrastructure support at most 127 keycodes. Most of the
keycods have been assigned. Unassigned keycodes can be bound to
multimedia keys without problem. Among those already assigned
keycodes, rarely used ones can be reassigned to multimedia keys as
well. The following is a list of keycods that can probably be
.Dq Li safely
reassigned.
.Bl -tag -width "Rarely used keycodes"
.It Unused keycodes
Currently unused keycodes include: 0x54, 0x5A, 0x5F,
0x60, 0x62, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x71, 0x72, 0x74.
.It Rarely used keycodes
0x73, 0x70, 0x7D, 0x79, 0x7B, 0x5C, 0xF2, 0xF1, 0x78, 0x77, 0x76.
These keycodes are most likely not used for English keyboard.
.It F13 - F24
0x64, 0x65, 0x66, 0x67, 0x68, 0x69, 0x6A, 0x6B, 0x6C, 0x6D,
0x6E, 0x76. These keycodes are for extra function keys found on
some keyboards and can be reassigned if your keyboard doesn't have
them.
